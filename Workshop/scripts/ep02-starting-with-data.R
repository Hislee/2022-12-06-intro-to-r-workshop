# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Topic: Downloading, reading, and inspecting the data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Lets download some data (make sure the data folder exists)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# now we will read this "csv" into an R object called "surveys"
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")


# and take a look at it



# BTW, we assumed our data was comma separated, however this might not
# always be the case. So we may been to tell read.csv more about our file.



# So what kind of an R object is "surveys" ?



# ok - so what are dataframes ?



# --------------------
# Exercise/Challenge
# --------------------
#
# What is the class of the object surveys?
#
# Answer:


# How many rows and how many columns are in this survey ?
#
# Answer:


# Bonus functions 



# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Topic: Sub-setting
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)


# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)


# first column of the data frame (as a vector)


# first column of the data frame (as a data frame)


# first row (as a data frame)


# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)


# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)


# equivalent to head(metadata)


# looking at the 1:6 more closely


# we also use other objects to specify the range


# We can omit (leave out) columns using '-'

# --------------------
# Exercise/Challenge
# --------------------
#Using slicing, see if you can produce the same result as:
#
#   head(surveys)
#
# i.e., print just first 6 rows of the surveys dataframe
#
# Solution:



# column "names" can be used in place of the column numbers and $ operator to isolate



# --------------------
# Exercise/Challenge
# --------------------

#Bonus functions:

# What's the average weight of survey animals
#
#
# Answer:

# Are there more Birds than Rodents ?
#
#
# Answer:



# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Topic: Factors (for categorical data)
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#Turning characters into levels


# factors that have an order



# --------------------
# Exercise/Challenge
# --------------------
#   1. Change the columns taxa and genus in the surveys data frame into a factor.
#   2. Using the functions you learned before, can you find outâ€¦
#        a. How many rabbits were observed?
#        b. How many different genera are in the genus column?


# Converting factors


# can be tricky if the levels are numbers


# so does our survey data have any factors

# Renaming factors



#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Topic:  Dealing with Dates
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# R has a whole library for dealing with dates ...



# R can concatenated things together using paste()


# 'sep' indicates the character to use to separate each component


# paste() also works for entire columns


# let's save the dates in a new column of our dataframe surveys$date 


# and ask summary() to summarise 


# but what about the "Warning: 129 failed to parse"
